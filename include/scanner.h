    ==== SCANNING SEGMENTS OUT OF A BUFFER ====

    The Scanner struct can be used to scan out string segments of four types, consisting of
    different character types for each string type, and are identified by the first character
    that is being pointed to by the current character index:

    TYPE            FIRST CHARACTER                             CHARACTER CONTENT

    Whitespace      Any Whitespace (isspace( ch ))              Any Whitespace (isspace( ch ))
    Numeric         Any Digit (isdigit( ch ))                   Any Digit (isspace( ch ))
    Alphanumeric    Any Alphabetic Character (isalpha( ch ))    Any Alphanumeric Character (isalnum( ch ))
    Symbolic        Any ASCII Symbol (issymb( ch ))             Any ASCII Symbol (issymb( ch ))

    These strings are considered separators of each other from each other. String types can only 
    be consistent of a certain type of character in the ASCII Character Set. This is considered 
    a neutral splitting, from whence tokens can easily be made.

    Example Input:
    "This is an++-- example      123numbers numbers123\n"

    Example Strings From Output:
    - "This"
    - " "
    - "is"
    - " "
    - "an"
    - "++--"
    - "example"
    - "      "
    - "123"
    - "numbers"
    - "numbers123"
    - "\n"
