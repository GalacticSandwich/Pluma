
IDEAS
 - Primitive Datatypes
	- Signed Integers
	- Unsigned Integers
	- Real Numbers
	- Strings
	- Boolean Logic
 - Pointers
 - Composite Datatypes
	- Tuples
	- Structs
	- Interfaces
 - Enum Types
 - Pure Functions vs. Routines
	- Pure Functions basically a Switch Statement (maybe faster)
	- Routines have code in between
 - Functions + Routines as distinct datatypes
 - Abstract Datatypes
	- Slice (like Golang Slices)
	- Map (probably a Hash Table)
	- Set (equiv. to a Pascal-Style Set, i.e. an array of booleans, or a Hash Table)
	- Stack + Queue (maybe as added Slice Functionality?)
	- Priority Queue (probably a Max or Min Heap)
	- Graph (too expensive?)
 - Several Different Loop Types
	- for loop + while loop
	- for-each loop for iterating over an iterable datatype
	- do-while loop for preumpting something which could be repeated
 - Added Mechanisms for Ease of Programming
	- Scanner / File
 - Memory Safety
 - Automatic Memory Management
	- No Garbage Collecting!
 - Rust-like and Go-like Syntax
	- Types come after variable/constant names
	- "->" is used to predenote the type returned by a routine or function
		- Functions must have a non-void return type
 - TitleCase used for all datatypes
	- This includes primitive types (Int32, Float64, String, etc.)
